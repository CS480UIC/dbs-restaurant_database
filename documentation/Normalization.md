First Normal Form: Made sure every table has a primary key

2nd NF: Made sure that all non-key columns depend on the entire primary key.

3rd NF: Made sure all non-key columns that depend on another column, that the dependent column is unique.

Boyce-Codd: Applied 3rd NF to all columns to eliminate redundancy, ensuring the database is in BC form.
